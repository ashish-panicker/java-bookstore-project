# Project Case Study: Bookstore System

## Project Overview
Develop an online bookstore system using Java where users can browse, search for books, add books to their cart, and place orders. The system should also include functionalities for book inventory management, user registration, and user login.

## Team 1: User Management
**Responsibilities:**
- Implement user registration and login functionalities.
- Create user profiles with information such as name, email, address, and order history.
- Use OOP principles to design User classes and interfaces.

**Concepts to Cover:**
- OOP (Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation)
- Collections (ArrayList, HashMap for storing user information)
- Unit Testing (JUnit for testing user registration and login functionalities)

## Team 2: Book Inventory Management
**Responsibilities:**
- Implement functionalities to add, remove, and update books in the inventory.
- Create book categories and allow searching/filtering books by category.
- Use OOP principles to design Book and Inventory classes.

**Concepts to Cover:**
- OOP (Classes, Objects, Encapsulation, Composition)
- Collections (ArrayList, HashSet for storing book information)
- Unit Testing (JUnit for testing inventory management functionalities)

## Team 3: Shopping Cart and Order Processing
**Responsibilities:**
- Implement functionalities to add/remove books to/from the shopping cart.
- Calculate total cost, apply discounts, and place orders.
- Use OOP principles to design Cart and Order classes.

**Concepts to Cover:**
- OOP (Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Encapsulation)
- Collections (ArrayList for storing cart items, HashMap for orders)
- Streams API (Filtering, mapping, and reducing cart items)
- Unit Testing (JUnit for testing cart and order functionalities)

## Team 4: Search and Browse
**Responsibilities:**
- Implement functionalities for users to search and browse books.
- Allow searching by title, author, or category.
- Use Streams API for efficient search and filtering.

**Concepts to Cover:**
- OOP (Classes, Objects, Inheritance)
- Collections (ArrayList for storing book information)
- Streams API (Filtering, mapping, and reducing book collections)
- Unit Testing (JUnit for testing search and browse functionalities)

## Deliverables
1. Detailed class diagrams and UML diagrams for each team's responsibilities.
2. Fully implemented and tested code for each module.
3. Comprehensive unit tests using JUnit for all functionalities.
4. Documentation for each module, including usage instructions and API references.
